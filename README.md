# Collected Alfred 2 workflows

Simple workflows for [Alfred version 2][alfred] that do not merit their own repository. Note you need the [Alfred Powerpack][alfred-powerpack] to enable workflows.

## Workflows included

### Refresh Finder

A straightforward port of Söderhavet’s [*Refresh Finder*][refresh-finder] utility to Alfred. Use a hotkey or the “refresh” keyword to force Finder to refresh the file listing in the frontmost window. Alternatively, all Finder windows can be refreshed (via another hotkey, or by holding down `alt` when actioning the keyword).
